    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This is my world famous shepherd's pie!</p>
        <p>I saved this recipe from my Aunt Nessy, who made this every Friday at the Loch.</p> 
        <p>This recipe is simple and for any cooking skill level. Packed with monstrous flavor,
        your family will eat this up before you can say <em>Oh Danny Boy!</em>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>5 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound lamb (or lean ground beef)</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. 
                Drain and mash. Mix in butter, finely chopped onion and 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. 
                Drain, mash and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then stir in flour and cook 1 minute. 
                Add ketchup and beef broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Next, spread a layer of mashed carrots. 
                Top with the mashed potato mixture and sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.</li>
